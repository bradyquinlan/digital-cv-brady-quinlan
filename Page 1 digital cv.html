        I grew up in Northboro, Massachusetts which is a town right outside of
        Worcester. I have lived there almost my whole life, but moved from
        Shrewsbury Massachusetts on my 6th birthday. I went to public school
        my whole life and love whereI live. The surrounding area is kind of
        boring through.</p>

      <p style="background-color: white (0, 0, 0); color: blue; font-family: Montserrat">I've been competing in MMA for the past couple years along with my
        dad and brother, and I also enjoy hanging out with friends and fishin. I
        have pretty much haf the same friend group of four guys since the
        beginning of high school back home, and I spend all of the free time I
        have with them outside of working out, working, and spending time with
        family.</p>


      <p style="background-color: white (0, 0, 0); color: blue; font-family: Montserrat">Back home I have one younger brother who is 16 years old and a
        sophomore in high school, my dad runs a manufacturing company, and my
        mom is a fitness instructor. We have a house in Maine, and spend a lot
        of out time in the summer there. We like to travel a lot, and have
        visited a lot of cool places. I am very very close with my whole family.
        My parents met when tehey were 22 when my dad was in the military, and
        they got engaged three months later. They have now ben together for 25
        years.</p>
